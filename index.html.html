        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a particular task. 
            Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
             The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
              The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 
             Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs.
             These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. 
            Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big"> Computer program and History, Programmer § History, and History of programming languages
            Programmable devices have existed for centuries. 
            As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.
            In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.
            In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
            
            Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. 
            In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.
            
            The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
            
            
            Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
            In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. 
            However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.

        <p class="sectionTag text-small">Programming|What is Programming:
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-big">You may already have used software, perhaps for word processing or spreadsheets, to solve problems. 
             Perhaps now you are curious to learn how programmers write software. 
             A program is a set of step-by-step instructions that directs the computer to do the tasks you want it to do and produce the results you want.

            There are at least three good reasons for learning programming:
            Programming helps you understand computers. The computer is only a tool. 
            If you learn how to write simple programs, you will gain more knowledge about how a computer works.
            Writing a few simple programs increases your confidence level. Many people find great personal satisfaction in creating a set of instructions that solve a problem.
            Learning programming lets you find out quickly whether you like programming and whether you have the analytical turn of mind programmers need.
            Even if you decide that programming is not for you, understanding the process certainly will increase your appreciation of what programmers and computers can do.
            
            A set of rules that provides a way of telling a computer what operations to perform is called a programming language.
            There is not, however, just one programming language; there are many. In this chapter you will learn about controlling a computer through the process of programming. You may even discover that you might want to become a programmer.
            
            An important point before we proceed: You will not be a programmer when you finish reading this chapter or even when you finish reading the final chapter.
            Programming proficiency takes practice and training beyond the scope of this book. However, you will become acquainted with how programmers develop solutions to a variety of problems.
